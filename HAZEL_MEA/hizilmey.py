st.write("I am a 1st Year student. As I grew, I nurtured a passion for learning through leadership in Church from being an ASM President, and this drive led me to graduate with honors from junior high school in Northern Eastern Mindanao Colleges (NEMCO), a milestone that marked not only academic achievement but also the culmination of years of dedication and hard work. Now, as I stand at the threshold of my future, I am filled with ambition and purpose. My sights are set on pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering, a field that captivates me with its blend of creativity, problem-solving, and real-world impact.")
